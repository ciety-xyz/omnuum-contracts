## Summary


There are a lot of NFT projects and PFP projects. But, there are limited tools and services for trying new project. Artists or creator whoever want to launch a new project needs several resources. FE developer, BE developer, DApp Developer, Artists, NFT image maker etc. To lowering entry barrier and encourage NFT projects for everyone, we are building those tools. 

Core contracts are NFT and several supportive contracts. NFT contract is based on ERC1155 with little changes. These are similar to previous NFT, PFP projects except reusability. Our goal is to build tool, so NFT contracts have to be deployed multiple times for each projects. This repository is our efforts to reach that goal.
